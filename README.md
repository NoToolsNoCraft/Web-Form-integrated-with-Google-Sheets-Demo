The Web app (pure front end HTML, CSS and JS) is basically a form component where the visitors are asked to fill their data such as their name, email and a message. You may find the whole front end code in the index.html document.

The submit button then sends the data to the integrated Google Sheet document.

The integration with Google Sheets works in a way that a Google Apps Script is set up. You may find the script I've used in the repository under the same name. The script is using the Google Sheet ID in order to connect with it.
